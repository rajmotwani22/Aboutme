## 👋 Hi, I'm Raj Motwani!

📊 I'm a Data Analyst with a knack for turning chaos into clarity using my skills in R, Python, Power BI, and SQL Server Management Studio. I don't just work with data—I delve into it, clean it up, and twist it into revealing powerful insights that help steer strategic decisions.

#### 📚 I am currently working towards a Master's degree in Information Technology & Analytics at Rutgers Business School in Newark, with an expected graduation date of December 2024.

### 👩‍💻 Work Experience

At **Rutgers University-Newark (Graduate Assistant)**, I orchestrated orientation programs for 2,000 students, enhancing our administrative insights with advanced Excel and data pipeline strategies. 

At **Indus Valley Partners (Associate Data Analyst)**, I developed data pipelines and implemented analytics tools in hedge fund operations, identifying cost-saving opportunities that saved $40,000 and improved operational efficiencies.

My tenure at **Accenture (Associate Data Analyst)** involved refining ETL processes for attrition data and enhancing data visualization with Power BI. 

As a **Data Engineering Intern at Trivia Software**, I built a retail management system and an out-of-stock alert system, streamlining inventory management and reducing stockouts.
